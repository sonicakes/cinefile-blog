Delighted to see a final boy instead of a final girl. Despite my better judgement, I was like 'Yeah girrrl! Go get it girrrrl!'

JK I was like WTF  - boiling water in your brain??? Where do you get those 'home-made lobotomy' recipes from, peeps? Actually, I'm now wondering if this is a real thing and whether it works. For no particular reason. '*Hey google...*'

Also, once I gathered that the main gal's name was Lola and she was wearing hot pink, I was like...

But seriously, they'd be besties, right? I can imagine Lola from [Big Mouth](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/74204-big-mouth) going for some Girl Boss Revenge Spree like that in response to her broken heart. You know what, that's one of the reasons I'm terrified to say NO to ppl. Like, what if next thing I know I'm at a Karaoke party with chicken wings & milk & hot-pink murderer?

The home-grown movie goes hard on the torture. I absolutely loved the 'domestic' hacks for torture weapons - kettle with boiling water, a drill, a fork, drain cleaner...Suddenly you don't need a gun to set up a Little Shop of Tortures. 

The most terrifying moment for me was the hole-drilling. Like, in all movies the mention of lobotomy is just horrifying for me to imagine. Anything to do with messing with the brain (especially done 'live', without anaesthetic) - a stuff for nightmares. It's very effective. Drain liquid injection takes #2 - brr needles. I guess the throat pipes will be really *unclogged* afterwards though?..

I didn't like that they portrayed Aussie school dance in the style of American prom. I have done my highschool years in Russia (where its not really prom but just a school dance/gathering and no one invites each other). From what I've heard here it could be a dance or a formal, but it's not that big of a deal, and there is no king/queen. I did love the pink crown from crackers. Legend.

Another thing that I found redundant is the Goth girl & her prom date plot - they didn't even get an invite to Lola's party or anything. Why are we following them?

What I really appreciated in the movie is a concept of a *Final Boy* instead of a Final Girl that we're so used to. It is so rare to see a male character being a helpless victim, which makes this movie stand out. **Girl power!**

Really loved this glittery torture flick. Giving it 8 out of 10 Frog Princes (uh-huh...if you know, you know).
