Move over, Wes Anderson. Before you even thought about your so-called 'Fantastic' Mr Fox, there was the Original = the Un-outfoxable Mr Black Fox, as portrayed by Danny Kaye in 1955 'Court Jester'. So, I ask, who is an *auteur* now?

```
you never outfox the fox...
you never outfox the fox...
```

This is most jolly, most joyful experience the movie can be to me. I will sing the Fox song (no, not the one [*'What does the fox say?'*](https://youtu.be/jofNR_WkoCE?si=Frzouaug1XCqsLw5), although it came to mind once or twice) and *'Life better be'* songs all the time. I will quote *'The Doge did what the Doge does'* and *'The pellet with the poison's in the vessel with the pestle; the chalice from the palace has the brew that is true!'* over and over. My whole Aussie family adores this movie (that's how I got introduced to it, actually). I was further taken by the campiness, the music, the performances, the chaos of it all. Love at first sight, followed by endless rewatches.

I literally cannot recommend it enough. It will lift my mood if I'm sad, it will make me prance around the room if I'm already feeling goofy. I will try to mimic the whistle and fail miserably, then just go back to

 two of me, three of me,
  four of me,
   five, six, seven
sorry, no more of me...

 to no end in sight.

At first I was convinced this movie was a musical, until I got into studying film history & genres on a deeper level and it looked like it was not classified as musical after all. To me, the songs and performances are intrinsical to experiencing CJ, however, if we judge it from musical definition - they do not, in fact, advance the plot, or are an essential part of the plot without which the movie would not make sense.

In my personal classification though, I put it in 'Musical', since I cannot imagine CJ without the main titles.

``` 
Life could not better be / 
Better be, better be / 
It could not possibly / 
No sirrah, sir-rah, sirree! / 
Songs could not gayer be / 
Sound your do-re-o-mi, re-mi-fa-so-la-see, fa-la-la-la follow me! /
```

Another important note - the campiness is exaggerated for me by the fact that such an obviously gay actor is performing 'straight' court jester sequences with two main ladies of CJ. The ridiculousness of it all. I know that it was not faux-pas to be gay in 1955, but there are some of the funny winks in the dialogue/songs, e.g. *Songs could not gayer be...* from above.

Before we conclude, one thing I noticed, that [Glynis Johns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glynis_Johns)' (playing Gene)  face reminded me of my own. Same round shape, blue eyes, brown hair...there's something about it. I might be wrong but...

All in all, 10/10 baby bottoms with purple pimpernels. Would recommend and would rewatch every time I need a mood lift!
