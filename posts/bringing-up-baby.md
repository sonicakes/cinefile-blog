For a movie that has Baby in its title, we see surprisingly little of it. I feel like I was cat-fished (*leopard-fished*, although technically still correct - Baby is a big cat). The movie poster features a little leopard seated in a baby feeding chair and Mum & Dad (Dad's wearing a woman's robe) hovering around the Baby.

There wasn't even a scene like that. The audacity to include that cute picture to lure the innocents!

Eh well. I still found the movie amuzing. I don't agree with Susan that David (played by Cary Grant) looks bad in glasses - he looks different, but still cute. Charming. Maybe we could try a different style glasses, not sure Harry Potter look works, but he's a-oh-kay to me. Suz got some weird preconceptions about glasses - maybe he appears too smart for her liking. Although she could use some of that brain matter from time to time...

> A leopard can't change its spots. But Susan can change her opinion on Cary Grant wearing glasses.

So, what did we get instead of a Baby Leopard in a pram? (we didn't get that, and we weren't really promised any, that's just me daydreamnig).

- There was indeed a leopard. Small. Seemed the size of my adult labrador (she is small tho).
- Baby Leopard was cute as.
- I wonder how they filmed it all..Coz Baby couldn't be CGI in 1938. Like, was it a well-trained pet leopard? How many chicken were sacrificed to get Baby on the roof?
- There was a cute doggy named George and he was funny and mischievious (but if I was George I would never give up my new bone. Finders keepers, mate.)
- Baby Leodaddy did wear a woman's robe. Too bad it wasn't also leopard-patterned.
- Chaos & rapid scenes. Everything happens so quickly and becomes absurd as fast. Loved the energy of it.
- Susan (played by Katherine Hepburn) definitely was growing on me as the movie progressed. I started with wanting to punch her in the face (she is so annoying, omg, pls shut up & get out of my way..I have this order and discipline and you are distrupting it all!). But then, half an hour in, I found myself enjoying her persona & actually cheering her on to break David's act of 'serious man'.

***
I think it's a funny, silly movie that leaves a good after-feeling about the main protagonists getting together at the end. What didn't leave a good feeling was the fact that Susan's aunt had ordered a 'tamed' baby leopard to be delivered to her city residence...Umm lady, this is a wild animal, not a pussycat. Well, its a wild pussycat. It can eat you for breakfast.

**8/10** baby leopards. I'm still fuming about absence of a scene featuring Dave & Suz feeding Baby in a toddler kitchen chair.
