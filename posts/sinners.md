The hype was soo huge. I've heard that Sinners have been nominated at the Oscars, and I haven't seen it for a while since after it first was released, so learning that it was available in Feb on SG airlines..I was like hell, yeah. It double-billed for me with Weapons.

Alas, I was disspointed. For me, the movie did not live up to the hype. I so wanted it to - but it just didn't do it for me. I expected more psych, dark horror than those drooling zombie vamps - don't ask me why. I probably shouldn't have!

>Can you play so well that vampires come by?

Also the guitar from hell..The one you can play & all the monsters come out? Idk. It simultaneously reminded me of Stephen King's short stories (I can't quite recall if he ever had anything to do with magic instruments, but somehow the vibe was similar)., and also kinda was silly. 

As such, I gave it 6 guitars from hell. I would still recommend it, because I believe it's a good story and some folks will find it more appealing. It did not scare me, but I would re-watch it, because, again, plane watches are not the most reliable ones (after how many Singapore Sling cocktails do you start loosing focus?
