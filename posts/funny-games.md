Funny games did not turn out as funny as I thought. In fact, they were not funny at all. All I felt was discomfort, dread and doom all the way through the movie, with various intensity, depending on the action. It reached its peak in psychologically tense torture scenes, and subsided on the prolonged scenes with little goings on. But on average, I was very uncomfortable throughout. Laughing was not on my mind, tell you what.

But of course, this is the whole point. I believe that 'Funny Games' (FG for shorts - ah, the iconic white shorts...) purpose was to achieve the opposite - to make you face the most uncomfortable, the most taboo things you probably avoid thinking about on a daily basis. For example, 

*How often do you imagine the following scenarios.*

 `Choose 'NEVER', 'RARELY', 'IT OCCURED TO ME ONCE', 'VERY OFTEN' or 'ALL THE TIME' options.`

- Getting invaded, tortured and eventually killed in your holiday house by strangers? 
- Finding out that you've been attacked for no particular reason, rather than *'why not'*? 
- Realising that you kind of let those strangers in yourself because you they 'looked presentable' - i.e. young, being white & wearing white? ('looking posh', I would call it).
- Oh, and my favourite one: being caught in the act of observing this show unfold, and also being forced to confront how and why you enjoy watching 'a nice family' being toyed with until they are all gone one by one (including the dog...RIP Rolfie)?

If you answered 'NEVER' or 'RARELY' to the above questions, congratulations - you've been spared watching the depravity that is FG. Unfortunately for you though, this article is full of spoliers and what are you even doing reading my dirty dark blogs for?

But you see what I'm going for here. Try answering those same questions after you've watched FG, and you probably put 'IT OCCURED TO ME ONCE' against some of the Qs. And that is, to me, an effective movie. It has made you think. It has made you wonder. You did not really want to entertain those thoughts, but here we are. In the way this movie pushes you into confronting the nastiest, filthiest possibilities, reminds me of 'Killing of a Sacred Deer' by Yorgos Lanthimos - review here. Don't want to spoil it here in case you're a virgin to that odd film - but it raises similarly uncomfortable questions of *'What would I do if this ridiculous thing happened to me'?* 

 Personally, I delayed watching FG for a while, knowing what it's about. I love listening to podcasts about horror, and sometimes I listen to episodes about films I haven't yet seen, but which I'm curious about, or maybe on the fence about watching. FG was one of those - the name itself was curious to me, but I could not remember if I've watched it before or whether I might even enjoy its plot. So I dove into one of my faves -  [Random Number Generator Horror Podcast # 9](https://www.nightvalepresents.com/rnghpn9), an episode about FG. And I loved it - both the episode & the themes of this movie. I'm kind of into dark stuff, so I put it on my watchlist straight away. 

A little digging revealed I had it in our local home movie collection and I went ahead and watched it....Hey - where is the remote? 

```-rewind-rewind-rewind...```

Ah. That's better. As I was saying, I spotted FG in our home movie collection, but I was avoiding it for a while. Knowing what is to come, what kind of feeling it would bring, and don't even start about Rolfie...

> Discomfort, dread and doom. I did not laugh once.

The feeling of strangers invading into your space and the dread it brings, is something I experienced in real life. I can recall at least a couple of incidents that FG reminded me of.

One of them was from my uni days back in Mother Russia. Home invasion, attacks, this was quite common knowledge when I was growing up. I carried a pepper spray everywhere (it was legal there then..not sure about now.) As a child, the strictest instruction was **NEVER TO OPEN A DOOR TO ANYONE, UNLESS ITS A FAMILY MEMBER**. This was instilled in me so strongly that I carry it within me to this day, even in a safe plsce like Australia (compared to my Motherland, that is). I think Russian 90s babies grew up with **STRANGER = DANGER** basically imprinted in our brains. You **NEVER** talk to strangers. You **NEVER** open door to strangers. God forbid you make **EYE CONTACT** with a stranger, or even worse, **SMILE** at them.

Now, you can imagine my shock when I moved to OZ and strangers not only **TALKED & SMILED** to me openly, but I also was expected to do the same back to them. Oh horror. It took some time to adjust and let myself relax around the premise that **STRANGER ≠ DANGER** all the time, and basically **STRANGER = FRIEND**, or in Aussie language, **STRANGER = MATE, HI HOW YA GOIN!** Oh, and did I mention people don't have double doors, at least one of which is a metal bunker door with several locks, in their habitations? Wha-at? It's **STRANGER PARADISE**, folks!

So yeah. In Russia it was easier to imagine the FG scenario unfolding... minus the *'they looked nice so we let them in'* bit, because no matter how good you look, remember: 

```
YOU ≠ FAMILY => YOU = STRANGER => YOU = DANGER
```

What a simple piece of logic! Follow this and you never have to play FG!

Well, unless FG sort of starts following you and stalking you. Those types of predator behaviour were not uncommon growing up, too. The particular instance I'm recalling, and the feeling of dread associated with it, as I mentioned previously, occured in my uni days, circa 2010. I was coming home in the dark, possibly from one of the dance or pilates lessons I attended earlier. Winter lasts ~ 9 months in where I lived, so it was dark more often than not. I walked or took the bus everywhere I could (being poor student and all), and my fitness studio was walking distance. Thinking about it now, the whole 'Girl Walks Home Alone at Night' situation (good film - check out review here) is horrifying to me. After living in a Wonderful Land of OZ for a decade, I could never imagine doing it now, day after day, walking alone at night to places, knowing that danger is, kind of, lurking around the corner. Back then, it seemed ordinary for me. Perhaps to most of girls my age too.

So I'm walking, in the late evening. And there's decent amout of people around to start with, it's a 1-million-people-city, people always walk behind you, in front of you, sometimes side by side. That's ok. But suddenly I felt and saw in my periphery this menacing shadowy presence behind me. More than that, IT was walking exactly where I was walking, same turns, same little paths, same deviations. I'm calling it IT, because I don't know its gender for sure - I was not brave enough to face 'them' and to me 'they' felt like IT...

I walked, IT followed. There could be a possibility IT resided in the same apartment block as me, of course, but did it have to follow so closely that I could see it in my periphery? Did IT have to also deviate, in the mud, where I did set off the path when I felt uncomfortable? I did not believe so.

Towards where I kept walking, fewer and fewer people were around, it felt like just us two... In the streets that were barely lit. My sense of dread overwhelmed me then, I felt like I was losing all control: *'what if it gets me, what do I do?'* *It's dark, no one else is round, and I don't remember if I have my pepper spray, and I have never actually properly used it before...* I also had my mobile phone, *what if IT attacked me first, knocked me over, what then???*

As I was walking, dread turned into panic. I decided to increase my pace to match my abnormally rapid heartbeat. I did not dare look back and face IT, and I also did not want to start running, in case IT ran as well, and managed to outrun me in the end (I was not into running then - I am on friendly terms with running now, though). I thought I would just walk madly fast towards the direction of home and pretend nothing was on my tail.

One thing became certain to me - *I must not let IT know where I lived*. I decided that I must mislead it and divert it elsewhere. Luckily, one of the ways I could walk home was through a newly built shopping mall, which was just coming up. The area around the mall benefited from construction, since the city was constructing some 'developed' (i.e. not open-ground, cement-covered) paths around it. Some of them even included street lights - yay for me! So I decided to walk home through those new paths that led to the shopping mall, and then I would try to 'lose' IT in there somehow, I guess? Maybe I was hoping to get help.  Also lucky for me, shopping malls in Russia close late. 10pm closing time is the norm. 

Meanwhile, I could still see and feel IT behind me on the path, now even in not-so-dark areas, so there was no doubt I was being followed. And it looked like a man, judging by a large, tall figure.

 You can love or hate the shopping mall (aka Chopping MAll), but that day I felt it saved my life. It stood in front of me, so brightly lit and shiny. It looked like a safe haven for me then, and I practically dashed into its revolving doors. 

I proceeded to get onto the closest escalator. I was too afraid to look behind me until I disembarked on the second floor. Only then I turned around and looked cautiously to the sides, and down to the 1st floor. I could not see IT anymore. I felt immense relief - perhaps I got lucky and IT left? Or was IT simply going shopping, minding ITS own business, accidentally just a little too close behind me, following exact same turn-offs and mini-paths? What a droid-paranoid I would be then, huh?

I could never really answer that question, although more likely I was, indeed, being followed that night. Probably, having reached a brightly-lit shopping center where people still were around (and CCTV, too!), IT abandoned its pursuit. I was lucky. But I will never forget the sense of dread, discomfort and impending doom. Exact same feelings that FG re-surfaced for me, at the moment when it becomes clear to us that the 'nice family' is trapped and is fully at the mercy of the perpetrators.

To clarify, I'm not saying those situations are similar, just that the feelings evoked in me were of the same caliber. I actually felt it even before the 'trap' was set - when those 2 'nice young men' only came to the door, I already felt uneasy. They did not seem nice to me. Partly, of course, I was aware of the plot (being spoilt by the pod previously), but something about them just repulsed me from the get-go. Especially the dark-haired gentleman, he instilled instant fear and loathing in me. Can't explain it, but it was quite visceral. I met people like this character in real life, and they never failed to terrify me. It seems to me that their perverse nature is often peeking a little from their 'normal' surface, and it's unsettling, to say the least.

What I'm trying to say is with those ramblings, that the feeling of dread, doom and discomfort from the real sistuations I experiences, re-surfaced in FG movie. That's why I'm awarding it 7 golf balls that fit in your shorts (so..3 in one pocket and 4 in the other? Or would you have back pockets as well?). If it wasn't for Rolfie, it would rate higher.

All in all, solid watch. Disturbing. I would recommend, but not for faint-hearted. And don't expect to laugh.
