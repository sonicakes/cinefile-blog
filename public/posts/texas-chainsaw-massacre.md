Sally, aka The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Final Girl.

I had to turn down the sound of the movie dramatically a few times because it was disturbing. I swear I can still hear it.

I have watched TTCSM before - as far as I recall, since it's such a classic. Definitely listened to a dozen of podcast episodes discussing the movie, so I knew exactly what to expect.

From the moment our group picks up a hitchhiker, I was like - eh, we're doomed, folks. C'mon, he looks *weird as*, even from the side of the road. Y'all kinda dag your own graves. No one else to blame. 

I loved Sally (especially her SCREEEEAAAAAAM). Loved her hair, her bralessness, white pants (gal was *fan-cy*). I thought her BF was a bit over-dressed for a roadtrip as well.

>That Sally gal sure can scream, alright.

Somehow I found the blood sucking scene most disturbing of all. The one where the grandpa (I legit thought he was a corpse, man - c'mon, who looks like that & is alive??? Maaaybe it's all the damn BBQ...too much of that...whatcha call it...HUMAN in it). Also - is the blood sucking suuposed to wake gramps from the dead? Is he a vampire? 

No idea about the chicken in the cage, it was kind of funny intertwined with scary music & closeups of bones & teeth.

I didn't mind the furniture. I guess IKEA doesn't really cut it out there, you gotta improvise. I felt like I was in a haunted house or a Halloween party - lit-up skeletons, bony dreamcatchers, and of course, an iconic lampshade made of some beautiful organic materials (*genuine leather*).

I can see why this movie is so loved by the horror community. It is not too gory (I mean the title kind of overhypes it - there is maybe a finger suck here and a sawn off leg there, at most.). Most of the gore is implied, and imagination runs wild from there on.

 The scene that had a potential of being super-gory kind of dissappointed me a little. The moment where Sally ran to the gas station & asked Leatherface Senior to get some help, we are shown a BBQ roasting oven - lots of large chunks of *stuff* hanging. It's supposed to be, like, a revelation for Sally & us - *ohh they're cannibals!* But I could not make out the shapes in detail, so I was not too convinced it looked different from a an oversized wildlife like a boar (or Texan variety of a kangaroo?)

The scene at the dinner table was ridiculously funny. Sally could not help but scream, which is fair enough, girl, keep at it. The Leatherface household sat her at the table and gave her some grub, but her hands were still tied - a bit rude, tbh. Y'all ever heard of a last meal out there in Texas Land?

That said, if Sally was allowed to eat, I imagine the meal would go something like [this scene in Scary Movie 2001](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMyIt076f1k).

I feel in two minds about the last scene where Sally makes it out. Is it a happy end? Coz you're traumatized for life now, girl. Also good luck eating meat ever again. How would you know for sure what it's made of?

The final scene of Sally in the truck, all bloody, madly *laughingcrying*, reminded me of [1976 Carrie](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/7340-carrie) a little. And the gals kind of look alike too, both blonde, young and pretty. Both gone a bit cray-cray by the finale, after what they have lived through. 

The biggest difference from Carrie, is that we don't see the immediate gratification of revenge. Wouldn't it be cool to see Sally roast Leatherface & fam with her mind alone? Alternatively, keeping the supernatural out of it, let Sally put on a mask and get armed with the latest model of a chainsaw to spruce a quiet Leatherface township with some mechanical roar. *BRRRRRRRRRR*

***

All in all, I enjoyed this one a lot. Super stoked Shudder has released it this month here in AU. Giving it **9.5** lampshades with a *genuine leather* touch, will rewatch not once but many times in future. Definitely recommend, but maybe not a good idea to combine this movie with eating a juicy hamburger meal. 

P.S. *Sally for Scream Queen!*
