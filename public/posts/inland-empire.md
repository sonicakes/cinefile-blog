This was an interesting exploration of Lynch's work. A 3-hour-long exploration, by the end of which I still am not sure what 'Inland Empire' refers to? Is is the world that Nicki steps into? Or am I missing something? 

I confess I haven't gone to Reddit or elsewhere to find things out. I guess I tried to abandon my disbelief and enjoy the art..

I was quite prepared for a 3-hour nightmare coming into this. And nightmare I got. Almost all the time I was not scared, until that all blown-up almost clownish picture of Laura Dern appears and we kind of make it out of the blur. This scared the living daylights of me. 

> What is the meaning of rabbits? Are they for business or pleasure?

I watched it in three parts, divided over 3 days. I was not closer to understanding any of the plot on day 3 than I was in day 1. Nor did I expect to.

When I was done, I felt a bit bad for 'not getting' it. I thought I probably was not a serious 'Lynchian' enough to get something like that. So I was kinda cautious of honestly admitting to myself that I didn't enjoy it as much as [Mulholland Drive](/blog/mulholland-drive), [Twin Peaks](/blog/twin-peaks) or [Blue Velvet](/blog/blue-velvet).

Things that I liked/ that worked for me:

- Poor camera, shaky & 'home movie-like'. I think it worked to add grit and horror, almost like your own POV which is not always 4K.
- Extremely close-up shots to the point of severe discomfort. There was one scene where I could see pores on the man's face.
- I love the idea of going from one physical space to end up at other universe, or even weird things like burning a hole in your silk panties to *see* in another dimension.
- One of my Lynch 'other world' effect is a flashing strobe light, terrifies me every time.
- Another one - gals dancing on the carpet and the next beat they're just gone. They were never even there.
- An idea of actors who are already playing other people, then made to play another film character is a little bit of a 'picture in a picture' situation. For some bizarre reason it reminded me of a 2004 TV Show [Garth Marenghi's Darkplace](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/205-garth-marenghi-s-darkplace), where Matthew Holness plays a horror writer Garth Marenghi, who in his turn stars in the fake tv show as Dr. Rick Dagless M.D.
- I enjoyed the idea of a 'cursed film', which was never finished because 2 protagonists were murdered. I was intrigued, since I have recently finished a book by Silvia Moreno-Garcia called 'Silver Nitrate'. The book focused on a similar 'cursed' movie that was was being re-made. I would looove to see a screen adaptation of that story, if there is ever one.
- Grace Zabriskie! I wished there was more of her.

*** 
I gave it 6/10 rabbits in pink robes doing ironing. I would like to re-watch it at some point, maybe I would get a different reading. I was not very scared throughtout, apart from a few scenes. I think it will be difficult to recommend to someone both because of the movie's length, camera's quality & non-linear plot.
