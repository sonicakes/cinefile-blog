I have gone to this movie blind. I only knew 2 things about the movie: first, that it was to do with Scotland. Second, that there were Russians.

I did not regret watching it, however I still am battling with the question - who is the 'Local Hero' supposed to be? Is it Ben Knox, who refuses to sell his beach to the big oil company? But what makes him a hero - he doesn't really go through any visible battles to keep the said beach, and apart from the last part of the movie, the character does not appear very often on screen (some beach wanderings here and there). I think I was a bit caught up in trying to find who the Hero is and waiting for the reveal that never happened.

> Someone told me 'Local Hero' is a comedy movie. I disagree - it's a sentimental piece.

**What I enjoyed most about the movie**:

1. Stunning views of Scotland. I want to visit ASAP. The sunsets, the water, if this is an ad for Scottish tourism, I am so sold.
2. The sentimental feelings that the movie gave me. The sadness I felt when MacIntyre returns to Houston, looking at his shell souvenirs. When he looks out of his balcony apartment and sees neither the stars, nor the Aurora Borealis in the sky,  my heart sank. You realize all this man wants, similar to Happer, his boss, is just to be there at the quiet beach, with Stella, with Urquhart, with Ben. It's the feeling of coming back from a place you felt like your new home, to your old place that no longer feels like your home, because you found something so profoundly more worthwhile elsewhere.

**What I wished was done differently**:

1. The story around Ben, I felt like we didn't get much of the back story of how he kept the beach going all those years, what's the reason he's living in a shack (boat shards ?). 
2. 'The Russians are coming' plot was under-handled for my liking (no, it's not because I'm Russian and I'm biased). Viktor seems like a nice enough Russian archetype, but does he bring anything to the plot apart from 'we are friendly with Soviets' vibe? What I was anticipating were things among the lines of Viktor being a spy, hence Happer instructing Mac previously to 'watch out for everything and report back to him', whether it's comets, stars or other. And with planes flying all the time above the village, I felt it could be part of 'Russians are coming' type of conspiracy. 

All in all, really enjoyable 2 hours spent in a dreamy-like Scottish landscapes. Someone told me this was a comedy - I disagree, I think it's a sentimental piece. The one where you feel sad at the end, but the tears are not quite there - you feel sad because 'it was good while it lasted'.

I gave LH 7 out of 10 seashells from a Scottish beach - really think Ben could be given more of a development story, if he is to be our Local Hero. Unless, it's Mac and I misunderstood the whole thing (wouldn't be the first time!). Still, I would recommend this movie.
