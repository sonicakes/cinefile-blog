My first watch of this Lynch classic happened back in Russia in the early 00s, with my Mum. Whether is was on TV or DVD, I can't recall, only that we were definitely Lynch & Naomi Watts fans and  fans and would not miss it for the world.

I remember playing a detective and trying to deduce all the clues about this movie, with no apparent success. Little did I know that this is not how one enjoys a Lynch film.

In fact, one should dispense all disbelief and just accept everything as it is. No pondering, no wondering, no meandering. Just absorb the art, let it melt and swaddle you in a cacoon.

On my first rewatch, I still could not let go of the inner detective, even though I completely forgot what the twist was and what to look for. I did not re-spoil  myself before this recent re-watch and just went straight into it. I have no regrets. This movies can be watched over, and over, whether you remember the twist or not. I mean, its probably best to wait 20 years between rewatches so it kinda feels like new but you still retain the feeling that you have seen and loved it before. 

I was looking for things, I definitely remembered the blue key. But what it was for, I could not recall.

Opposite to the *'blew my mind completely'* kind of feeling of the initial watch, this time I more of a *'aaaah - thats what it it!'* feeling. I did not need post-movie reddit trip or just detective work to put clues together. It was clear as day to me: first part is a dream. Second part is reality. Life is a dream, maybe, or most likely nothing means nothing.

I love how Lynch tells a dream - it does feel like one, if I recall any of my dreams. People from the past and people I just saw in a grocery store pop up, they are maybe different characters. Everything is shiny and nice, but at some point that comes a 'glitch' moment, similar to what Diane has at club Silencio, when it all shudders, you feel like something is wrong, and hey, soon you will wake up. Imagining yourself dead or someone else dead or alive or vice versa, that happens a lot too. To me, at least.

I have always been a Lynch fan, but I can't say I unconditionally love all his work. Twin Peaks - movie and TV show both have a special place in my heart (see this article), but some films like Blue Velvet (here) or even Inland Empire (here), are a little too Lynchian for me (no offence Mr Lynch - it's all subjective and I still think you are an amazing creator). Mullholland Dr. , however, is a kind of movie that has a great story, beautiful main characters and weird things happening all over. Despite it being not scary at all (well, almost, now I remember that black-ish creature from behind Winkie's diner, it kind of jumped on me tbh), I will proudly give this 8 out of 10 blue boxes (how does it fit inside the purse? And inside a woman's purse, specifically? Maybe this is kind of Harry Potter scenario from book 7 where Hermoine has a botomless bag that still looks cutesy small.)
