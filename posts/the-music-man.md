Who doesn't love a story about a conman?

Yeah. I like the ones where the con is revealed and the man behind the scheme is apprehended. 

Alas, this is not what happened in The Music Man. I was a little infuriated that he not only didn't pay for his deeds, but instead got a happily-ever-after with Marion the Librarian. 

I'm all for good enterpreneurship, but still it felt like some semblance of a reprimand was missing. Maybe we could at least assign some community service to the fake professor? And throw in a few mandatory music lessons, too.

Apart from atrocious sense of injustice at the end, I found The Music Man to be a good (maybe slighly long-ish) weekend watch. Loved the *shapoopies*, the songs, the dances. It was colourful and silly-style funny. 

I would never even think about watching Music man if it wasn;t for the recent 'IT:Welcome to Derry' TV Show, where in the 1st episode the kids are watching MM in a movie theater. So, here we are.

I don't think I watch too many musicals on TV. I prefer them in theaters, live. I absolutely love performances. On TV, I watched Chicago, Hairspray, Grease & Singing in the Rain. I then saw those said musicals in theaters live and enjoyed them way, way more there. There's just something about live singing and dancing, maybe even MM' would look different to me if I saw them in person. Hey, if there is a MM musical coming to Sydney anytime soon, I'm game! Bring on the Live Shapoopies!

All in all, great family weekend watch. Lighthearted and silly (if you forget about the treachery and lies of 'Professor' Hill), I would recommend and definitely check out a live performance if/when it's in AU. 7/10 singing & dancing shapoopies.
