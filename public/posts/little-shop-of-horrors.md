Even though there was only one little horror in the shop (Audrey Junior) that promised multiple from its title,  I was very entertained by this cute little picture.

Mr Mushnik & Seymour's mum especially entertained me. Oh, and what about the guy who comes in, orders some carnations, then whips out pepper from his pocket, sprinkles it on the flowers & proceeds to eat them? No one at the florist's seemed impressed though...

I liked the monster plant, although its vocabulary seemed a bit limited. It was intelligent enough to hypnotize Seymour at some point, and still most of the time it would screech 'FEED ME', or 'FOOD'. Playing the waiting game.

The mysterious plant reminded me of the [Day of the Triffids](https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/2609-the-day-of-the-triffids). Maybe at the end, Audrey Jr did not die, or it succeded to reproduce before death, so we have the Triffids later. Yes, I know that Seymour says he created it, but who can really trust that guy - just ask Mr Mushnik.

I felt that the sunflowers with the poorly printed pics of Audrey Jr's victims were a bit...*odd*. I guess Triffids got rid of that feature in their latest presentation.

Entertaining watch, not an ounce of horror. This could be a children's movie. I gave it 7/10 Audrey Juniors. I wish there were more items in the shop of horrors to make company for our little monster. But hey, at least we got Baby Triffid. RIP buddy.
