What's a better place to watch horror movies than a plane?

That's exactly what I did. I've been hyped to see this movie for a while, so when Sydney to Singapore flight presented me with 8hrs of potential watching time, I've had my flight playlist already sorted. Of course, there was more items om the list than the plane flight, but  my top 2 picks basically completed my double bill: Weapons & Sinners. (I realized even though each movie is 2hr, there is still 4 hrs of 'movie' time I didn't use. Well, there is nap time & what about the time spent pondering whether I want chicken or fish for lunch?).

## Spooks

1. Aunt Gladys crouching in the corner during Julia Garner's dream.
2. Creepo kid with clown makeup sitting & smiling whilst his classmates are 'sleeping' on their desks.
3. Kids with their arms splayed out like birds full-on attacking, crashing through glass. Unstoppable force.

## Liked

1. Julia Garner. Obsessed with her since the [Ozarks](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5071412/) & [Inventing Anna](https://letterboxd.com/film/inventing-anna/).
2. 'Chapter'-like narration style. Interested to see each character's POV & how they connect, even though at times I became impatient to get to the the VVitch.
3. Love when they make school haunted & spooky. It's so creepy when jsut 1 boy is there in an empty class. Like, something is gonna be up with that boy for sure.
4. Loved the way Auntie G paralyzed and manipulated people. I guess that's the ultimate weapon, hey. But still - do you have to feed'em spaghetti every day? How about some tuna from the can or some KFC maybe?

## Not sure how to feel

Aunty G's whole clown getup. It is def unsettling, but also kind of like - it is so out there that wouldn't anyone at school like the principal comment on it? And how is it trying to 'fit in' if that's what she's trying to do?

I will definitely re-watch this when I get a chance, since somehow the attention span on the plan leaves much to be desired. I mean, they keep interrupting with those announcements about fastening your seatbelts or some thing called Turbulence. Mate, I gotta see if the VVitch ate the kids or something, alright?

All in all, solid 8 annoying bully classmates that just dissapear one day. Dream come true!
