Lucky for me, I am an only child. As such, my parents would never have to go travel my school and ask the principal who they think is better - me or my sibling? They would more likely follow [Last-In-First-Out](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/lifo.asp) approach - I am the youngest of us three. And it's not like I was gonna cure Cancer or go to the Moon anyways. 

Much like the light-hearted intro above, Lanthimos' *'Killing of a Sacred Deer'* does not hold off on delivering *'WTF did I just watch'* kind of aftertaste after at the end of the movie. It expands on a famous ["Sophie's Choice"](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/15764-sophie-s-choice) - an impossible choice of trying to choose one of your offspring to sacrifice (*spolier*: but she does it at the end!). Similar to shows like [The Weakest Link]('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Weakest_Link_(British_game_show)') or [Big Brother](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0257295/plotsummary/), the loser gets the boot (in our case - the shoot).

Even knowing I will probably never have to make Sophie's choice (well, it's **ANYONE BUT MY DOG**, really), this movie got me thinking a lot. *'But what if...'* kept going in circles in my head, trying to see which family member has wronged me recently to deserve elimination (**I REPEAT, THE DOG IS ABSOLUTELY OUT OF THE QUESTION**).

What strikes me the most about KOTSD is the deadpan dialogue and delivery of actors playing out this insane scenario. Dr Daddy (Colin Farrell) tries to make a rational choice of comparing his 2 kids (I guess for him the wife was always out of the question. Hey, it's Nicole Kidman, after all...). But of course, he cannot make that choice, so he leaves it to fate & just plays a wholesome game of Russian roulette with the fam. *Spoiler alert*: the boy gets evicted by public vote/gun.

> Another interpretation of Sophie's Choice.

I guess the matter-of-factness of the situation unfolding is here to highlight the absurdity of it. I was convinced that Dr Daddy will be good enough at least to maaaybe offer himself as sacrifice? I am not sure that it was ever a choice, but still. A noble Daddy would.

Or maybe even like call BS on Martin, call the police, call the exorcist... Do something rather than - 'OK so I guess I have to see which member of my fam is more dispensable'. Nah. He accepts it at face value, and kids engage serious competition to gain Daddy's votes. Mummy is lucky she is Nicole Kidman, or she'd have to participate in the Family Olympics too.

I really enjoyed the whole circus of it, the darkness of it. I think it could be better without the supernatural plot of a curse being put on the family & them dying one by one by a mysterious illness. Martin could just kill off them by man-made weapons instead. This kid gives me serious ['We need to talk about Kevin'](https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/71859-we-need-to-talk-about-kevin) vibes.

***

All in all, **8/10** sacred deer that never even appeared in the movie. My bit of wisdom to you is this: love everyone in your family equally, but when push comes to shove, **SAVE THE DOG FIRST**.

P.S I guess if you're a cat person you can save the cats first.
